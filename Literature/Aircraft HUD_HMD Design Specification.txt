Advanced Avionics Visualization: A Technical Analysis of Head-Up and Helmet-Mounted Display Architectures in A-10A, F-15C, UH-60, and AH-6 Platforms
1. Introduction and Architectural Framework
This report presents a comprehensive technical dissection of the primary flight visualization systems—specifically Head-Up Displays (HUD) and Helmet-Mounted Displays (HMD/HMCS)—employed by four distinct combat aircraft: the Fairchild Republic A-10A Thunderbolt II, the McDonnell Douglas F-15C Eagle, the Sikorsky UH-60L Black Hawk, and the Boeing AH-6 "Little Bird." The analysis is conducted through the lens of high-fidelity flight simulation, specifically within the Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) ecosystem, examining the convergence of real-world avionics specifications with their software-defined implementations.
The objective is to provide a "deep descriptive structure" of these systems. This necessitates moving beyond a superficial cataloging of symbols to an analysis of the underlying display logic, coordinate systems (milliradians versus pixels), sensor fusion mechanics, and the specific Lua-based definitions that govern their digital replication. This document is intended for technical integrators, cockpit builders, and avionics researchers requiring precise data on component placement, functionality ranges, and typographic standards.
1.1 The Physics of Collimated Symbology
To understand the structural requirements of these displays, one must first address the optical physics governing their operation. In all four subject platforms, the primary goal of the display system is to present flight-critical data focused at optical infinity.1 This collimation allows the pilot to maintain situational awareness of the external environment without the need for accommodation (refocusing the eye) when scanning instrument data.
In the simulation domain, this optical collimation is achieved through parallax projection logic. The symbology is not rendered as a 2D overlay on the combiner glass texture; rather, it is drawn on a virtual frustum projected meters ahead of the design eye point (DEP). This distinction is critical for defining "ranges" and "measures." A symbol defined as being "100 pixels" to the right in a texture file does not have a fixed screen position; its final location is a function of the virtual head position, the collimation shader geometry, and the angular subtension defined in the aircraft's HUD_definitions.lua file.2
The A-10A and F-15C utilize fixed combiner glasses with limited Instantaneous Fields of View (IFOV), creating a "keyhole" effect where the pilot must physically shift their head position to view symbology clamped to the edges of the optical limit.1 Conversely, the UH-60L's AN/AVS-7 and the AH-6's Scorpion system are head-mounted, meaning the display frustum is slaved to the pilot's cranial orientation, requiring complex transformation matrices to keep conformal symbology (like waypoints or target markers) "pinned" to the terrain while non-conformal data (like airspeed) remains static relative to the skull.4
1.2 The Digital Control Environment: Lua Architecture
The structural "DNA" of these displays within the DCS environment is encoded across three distinct execution layers. A nuanced understanding of these layers is required to interpret the functional data presented in this report.
1. The Export Environment (Export.lua): This layer handles the extraction of raw telemetry from the simulation engine. Functions such as LoGetSelfData(), LoGetTWSInfo(), and LoGetIndicatedAirSpeed() operate here.6 This is the "backend" data source. For external cockpit builders, this is where the raw values for Airspeed (knots) or Altitude (meters/feet) are harvested before being visualized.
2. The GameGUI / Hook Environment: Operating in the Scripts/Hooks directory, this layer manages the simulation state and can intercept rendering calls. It acts as a bridge, utilizing net.dostring_in() to inject code into the mission environment or extract data from the export environment, though recent security updates (DCS 2.9.18+) have tightened the permeability of this layer.8
3. The Cockpit Device Environment: This is the rendering layer where the actual HUD symbology is drawn. Files such as HUD_definitions.lua, HUD_COMMON_page.lua, and materials.lua define the font textures, line thicknesses, and angular scaling factors (K-values).3
The analysis that follows synthesizes data from all three layers to reconstruct the exact specifications of the displays.

2. Fairchild Republic A-10A: The AN/AVQ-29 Head-Up Display
The A-10A utilizes a standard analog HUD, originally the Kaiser AN/AVQ-29. As a dedicated Close Air Support (CAS) platform, its display philosophy prioritizes ground stabilization and high-contrast symbology capable of remaining legible against the noise of varied terrain. It is a monochromatic (green P-43 phosphor) Vector CRT display.
2.1 Deep Descriptive Structure and Layout
The A-10A HUD is structurally divided into four primary quadrants for flight data, with a central "working area" for aiming reticles. The coordinate system is defined in milliradians (mils) relative to the Gun Cross (the boresight reference).
2.1.1 The Central Aiming Reference (Boresight)
The geometric center of the HUD logic is the Gun Cross.
* Position: Fixed at 0 degrees azimuth and +2 degrees elevation relative to the aircraft waterline (WL).10
* Function: Represents the harmonized boresight of the GAU-8/A Avenger cannon.
* Depressible Pipper: Located structurally "above" the digital logic, this is a backup sight consisting of a pipper dot centered in a segmented circle.
   * Range: Manually adjustable via the Up-Front Controller (UFC) rocker switch from +10 mils (up) to -300 mils (down).11
   * Usage: In the event of catastrophic computer failure, the pilot manually inputs the depression angle for a specific dive/speed combination to aim "iron" bombs or the gun.
2.1.2 Flight Path and Energy Management
* Total Velocity Vector (TVV):
   * Structure: A circle with three radiating fins (9, 12, and 3 o'clock positions).
   * Function: Indicates the actual trajectory of the aircraft (Flight Path Marker).
   * Logic: The TVV is "caged" to the HUD field of view. If the crosswind crab angle exceeds the lateral limits of the glass (approx 7-8 degrees), the TVV clamps to the side of the HUD (ghost vector), indicating the pilot is flying "out of the HUD".11
* Pitch Ladder:
   * Structure: Horizontal bars graduated in 5-degree increments. Positive pitch lines are solid; negative pitch lines are dashed.
   * Compression Logic: The A-10A utilizes a unique compression algorithm. In Navigation (NAV) and Air-to-Air (A/A) modes, the pitch ladder is compressed (often at a 4:1 ratio) to allow the pilot to see extreme pitch attitudes (e.g., +/- 30 degrees) without the lines disappearing off the top or bottom of the combiner glass.13 In Air-to-Ground (CCIP) and Landing (LDG) modes, the ladder reverts to 1:1 conformality to ensure the TVV and target designation cues align perfectly with the external world.
* Potential Flight Path (PFP): (Note: A-10C specific, but rudimentary elements exist in A-10A logic). A dashed symbol indicating available energy.
2.1.3 Peripheral Data Tapes (The "T" Arrangement)
* Airspeed Tape (Left Bound):
   * Range: 50 to 550+ knots Indicated Air Speed (IAS).
   * Scale: Moving tape with tick marks every 10 knots and numeric headers every 50 knots.14
   * Font: Uses the standard "USAF Stroke" font defined in font_HUD_A10.
   * Acceleration Cue: A "caret" or "worm" moves vertically alongside the tape to indicate energy trend (acceleration/deceleration).
* Altitude Tape (Right Bound):
   * Range: -1,000 to 50,000 feet.
   * Function: Displays Barometric Altitude (MSL) on the tape.
   * Radar Altitude: A digital readout appears below the tape (e.g., "XXXX R") when the radar altimeter is active and the aircraft is below 5,000 feet AGL.11 If above 5,000 feet or the system is off, the digital readout is removed.
* Heading Tape (Top Bound):
   * Range: 000 to 359 degrees.
   * Markings: Ticks every 5 degrees, numeric labels every 10 degrees. The current heading is indicated by an inverted caret at the top center.
2.2 Functional Modes and Symbology
The A-10A HUD mode logic is strictly segregated, changing the "deep structure" of the central display area.
1. Navigation Mode (NAV):
   * Clean display. Shows Waypoint (Steerpoint) info in the lower right block: Waypoint Number, ID, Distance (NM), and Time-to-Go (TTG).14
   * TDC (Target Designation Cue): A box cursor slewable via the HOTAS. In A-10A, designating with this creates a stabilization point for coordinate bombing.
2. Air-to-Air Mode (A/A):
   * Gun Funnel: A serpentine tunnel consisting of two weaving lines. The width of the funnel corresponds to the wingspan of the target (manually set, e.g., 35ft for a fighter) at the computed range. The pilot flies the target into the funnel to ensure a firing solution.
   * AIM-9 Reticle: A large circle representing the seeker head Field of View (FOV). An audio tone ("growl") correlates with the visual cue.
3. Air-to-Ground Mode (CCIP/CCRP):
   * CCIP (Continuously Computed Impact Point): Displays a "Death Dot" (Pipper) connected to the TVV by a "PBIL" (Projected Bomb Impact Line). The reticle unwinds (a dashed circle becomes solid) as range parameters are met.15
   * Solution Cue: A horizontal bar on the PBIL that drops down as the release solution approaches.
2.3 Technical Specifications: Pixels, Units, and Fonts
The digital replication of the A-10A HUD relies on specific definitions found in the DCS file structure.
* Angular Definition: The HUD FOV is defined as approximately 20 degrees circular.
* Texture Coordinate System:
   * The HUD drawing area is typically defined on a 2048x2048 canvas.
   * Placement Example: The Radar Altitude numeric block is positioned at coordinates {[70, -64, 0.0]} relative to the HUD optical center {0,0}.3 This 70 represents horizontal displacement in texture units, not pixels directly, but scaled by the K-factor.
* Scaling Factor (K-Value):
   * The size of the symbology is governed by the old_K and new_K variables in HUD_definitions.lua.
   * Default: old_K = 73.5, new_K = 73.5.
   * Formula: FontSizeX1 = 0.0058 * (old_K / new_K).16
   * Implication: To enlarge the font for readability on lower-resolution screens, new_K must be reduced (e.g., to 49). This inverse relationship confirms that K represents a divisor in the angular subtension calculation.
* Font Types:
   * Name: The system calls font_HUD_A10.
   * Style: A monospaced, sans-serif stroke font designed to mimic vector writing. It has zero anti-aliasing in its raw form to simulate the sharp beam of a CRT.
   * Resolution: High-resolution mods replace the default 512x512 font texture atlas with 1024x1024 or 2048x2048 DDS files to ensure crisp edges at high zoom levels.17
   * Stroke Width: Configurable in materials.lua, typically set to a "thickness" value of roughly 0.6 to 0.8 units to mimic the phosphor persistence fuzziness.18

3. McDonnell Douglas F-15C Eagle: The AN/AVQ-20 Head-Up Display
The F-15C employs a dedicated Air Superiority HUD. Unlike the A-10A, its symbology is derived largely from the radar system (AN/APG-63), leading to a "VSD-on-HUD" (Vertical Situation Display) design philosophy.
3.1 Deep Descriptive Structure and Layout
The F-15C HUD is physically smaller than modern wide-angle HUDs, creating significant integration challenges in simulation regarding the pilot's eye point.
3.1.1 Optical Limits and The "Keyhole"
* Field of View: The AN/AVQ-20 provides a 20° x 20° TFOV.
* Milliradian Mapping: The horizontal extent covers approximately 350 mils.
* Camera Limit: The MSIP HUD camera records a slightly wider FOV of 24.45° (Horizontal) x 18.46° (Vertical), or 426.7 x 322.1 milliradians.19
* The Keyhole Effect: In DCS, if the virtual pilot's head is placed against the ejection seat headrest (realistic posture), the HUD frame obscures much of the symbology (e.g., altitude/speed tapes). The symbology is projected at infinity, so moving the head backward reduces the angular window through the glass.1 To view the full 20-degree raster, the pilot must lean forward.
3.1.2 Central Flight References
* Waterline Symbol (W): A distinct "W" shape fixed at the center, representing the aircraft's longitudinal axis.10
* Velocity Vector: Represents the flight path. In the F-15C, the TVV is often uncaged but will clamp to the HUD limits during high-drift maneuvers (landing in crosswinds).
* Heading Tape: A linear scale across the top.
   * Unit: Degrees (00-36).
   * Density: High-density markings compared to the A-10, requiring a finer font.
3.1.3 Radar Integration Symbology (VSD-on-HUD)
The distinguishing feature of the F-15C HUD is the projection of radar data.
* Target Designator Box (TD Box): A square superimposed over the radar-locked target.
   * Function: Indicates line-of-sight to the primary target (PDT).
   * Limit Logic: If the target drifts outside the HUD FOV, the box clamps to the edge and flashes, or a "Target Locator Line" (a vector arrow) appears originating from the gun cross pointing toward the target.
* ASE Circle (Allowable Steering Error): A large circle used for AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-120 AMRAAM employment.
   * Diameter: Varies dynamically based on missile kinematic envelope (20 to 60 mils).
   * Steering Dot: A small dot that must be centered within the ASE circle to minimize missile maneuvering energy at launch.21
* Dynamic Launch Zone (DLZ): A vertical scale on the right side of the HUD (distinct from the Altitude tape).
   * Raero (Range Aerodynamic): The absolute maximum kinematic range of the missile (Triangle caret).
   * Ropt / Rpi: Range of Probable Intercept (effective range).
   * Rne (No Escape): The range at which the target cannot kinematic defeat the missile by turning 180 degrees.
   * Rmin: Minimum arming/safe launch range.
   * Target Caret: Indicates the target's current range relative to these zones. Closure rate (Vc) is displayed numerically above the scale (e.g., 950>).21
3.2 Functional Modes
* LRS (Long Range Search): HUD shows minimal radar data; primarily navigation.
* TWS (Track While Scan): HUD displays primary target (PDT) and potentially secondary targets if designated.
* STT (Single Target Track): Full symbology: TD Box, ASE Circle, and DLZ.
* HOJ (Home On Jam): When the radar is jammed, the TD Box becomes a vertical line (Strobe) indicating azimuth but no range. The weapon cue changes to "HOJ" or "AOJ" (Angle On Jam).22 The DLZ disappears because range is unknown.
3.3 Technical Specifications: Pixels, Units, and Fonts
* Font Type: The F-15C uses a stroke font similar to the A-10 but with thinner line weights.
* Texture Files: Located in Mods\aircraft\F-15C\Cockpit\Resources\IndicationTextures.
* Color Control: Defined in HUD_init.lua and materials.lua.
   * Default Color: High-intensity Green (RGB 0, 255, 0).
   * Mods: Users often modify the alpha channel of the HUD glass texture (.dds) to darken the background, artificially increasing the contrast of the green font because the default DCS lighting can wash out the symbology against bright clouds.23
* Scripting Access:
   * Data is exported via LoGetTWSInfo() and LoGetTargetInformation() in the Export environment.
   * Range Units: The F-15C HUD displays range in Nautical Miles (NM). In the DLZ, the scale is logarithmic.
   * Closure Rate: Displayed in Knots (relative velocity).

4. Sikorsky UH-60L Black Hawk: The AN/AVS-7 (ANVIS HUD)
The UH-60L presents a radical departure from the fixed-wing platforms. It typically lacks a panel-mounted HUD. Instead, flight data is injected into the pilot's night vision goggles via the AN/AVS-7 Aviator’s Night Vision Imaging System Heads-Up Display (ANVIS HUD).
4.1 Structural Implementation and Limitations
* Monocular Architecture: The AN/AVS-7 is a "clip-on" device that projects imagery into one eye (typically the right eye). This creates "binocular rivalry," where one eye sees the intensified world + symbology, and the other sees only the world.
   * DCS Implication: In the UH-60L Mod, the HUD is simulated as a Night-Only system. It is only visible when the NVG effect is active. The "Day HUD" (a combiner glass adapter for standard visors) is considered rare and is not currently implemented in the primary community mods (v2.0).25
* Field of View: The symbology is confined to the 40-degree circular FOV of the AN/AVS-9 NVG tubes.
4.2 Symbology Modes and Functions
The AN/AVS-7 uses a "declutter" philosophy, with four programmable modes.
4.2.1 Cruise Mode (Normal Flight)
* Center: Pitch and Roll attitude indicator (Artificial Horizon). Unlike fixed-wing HUDs, this is often a smaller, simplified line to avoid cluttering the view of terrain.
* Top: Heading Tape (Linear, 360 degrees).
* Left: Indicated Airspeed (Digital, Knots). Note: The UH-60L airspeed indicator becomes unreliable below ~20 knots due to rotor downwash on the pitot tubes.
* Right: Barometric Altitude (Digital, Feet) and Vertical Speed (VSI).
* Bottom Center: Torque (TRQ). This is the primary power management instrument for a helicopter pilot. It is displayed as a percentage (e.g., 85%).27
4.2.2 Hover / Transition Mode
* Velocity Vector (Bob-Up): When transitioning to hover, the display changes to emphasize drift. A vector line indicates the direction and magnitude of drift (forward/aft/left/right).
* Radar Altitude: Becomes the primary altitude reference. Displayed as a vertical thermometer scale or digital readout, critical for Nap-of-the-Earth (NOE) operations (0 to 1,500 ft range).27
* Trim/Ball: A digital representation of the inclinometer (slip/skid ball) to aid in coordinated flight.
4.3 Technical Specifications
* Resolution: The real AN/AVS-7 CRT has a resolution of roughly 480-640 lines. In simulation, this is rendered at the full screen resolution but masked by the NVG circular texture.
* Lua Definitions:
   * Scripts are located in Cockpit/Scripts/ANVS or HUD within the mod folder structure.
   * Coordinates: The coordinate system is centered {0,0} on the NVG ocular.
   * Range: The Radar Altimeter logic switches from analog tape to digital readout typically above 200 feet or 1000 feet depending on the sub-mode.

5. Boeing AH-6 "Little Bird": Thales Scorpion HMCS
The AH-6J/M (Little Bird) represented in modern DCS mods utilizes a hybrid sighting system. While older variants used simple reflex sights or the AN/AVS-7, the modern standard is the Thales Scorpion Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS).
5.1 Deep Descriptive Structure: The Scorpion System
The Scorpion differs fundamentally from the A-10/F-15 HUDs and the AN/AVS-7.
* Display Type: Full-Color Waveguide Display. It is not a CRT; it uses a specialized lightguide optical element (LOE).28
* Tracker: Utilizes a Hybrid Optical-based Inertial Tracker (HObIT). This allows for essentially zero-latency head tracking and high-precision overlay of conformal symbology on the real world.5
* Field of View: 26° x 20°. This is a large rectangular FOV that moves with the pilot's head.
5.2 Symbology Layout and Functions (DCS Implementation)
The Scorpion implementation in the DCS AH-6J Mod provides distinct symbology sets.29
5.2.1 Navigation and Flight Data
* Heading Tape: A 360-degree conformal tape that spans the horizon line. As the pilot turns their head, the tape moves to match the magnetic heading of the view.
* Waypoints: Rendered as "Lollipops" (circles on sticks) or diamonds floating in 3D space. They are conformal—they stay pinned to the geographic coordinate of the waypoint regardless of head position.
* Data Block: Lower quadrant displays Distance to Waypoint (NM) and Time-to-Go (TTG).
5.2.2 Weapon and Sensor Management
* Sensor Point of Interest (SPI): A crosshair or square designated on the ground.
* TADS/Sensor Slaving:
   * Pilot (PLT) vs. Copilot-Gunner (CPG): The display shows who is controlling the sensor.
   * Cued Line of Sight: A dashed crosshair indicates where the sensor (FLIR/TADS) is looking. A solid crosshair indicates where the pilot is looking. A vector line connects them, guiding the pilot to align their head with the sensor target.30
* Weapon Symbology:
   * Rocket I-Beam: Due to the AH-6's articulating rocket pylons (which can tilt up/down to compensate for speed/drop), the aiming reticle is an "I-Beam" or dynamic cursor that moves vertically in the HMD to indicate the computed impact point based on the pylons' current elevation angle.31
   * Gun Cross: A fixed cross for the M134 Miniguns.
5.3 Technical Specifications and Color
* Color Palette: Unlike the green-only displays, Scorpion supports 24-bit color.
   * Friendly: Blue/Green.
   * Hostile: Red.
   * Navigation: Green/Cyan.
* Lua Logic:
   * The draw_text functions in the AH-6 Lua scripts typically utilize a font size scaling factor of roughly 0.004 to 0.008 (normalized screen height units).
   * Coordinate System: Requires a 6-DOF transformation matrix. The symbols are defined in world coordinates (Lat/Long/Alt) and projected into the HMD's screen space based on the pilot's head quaternion.

7. Integration and Scripting Insights
7.1 The "net.dostring_in" Mechanism
For mission creators and cockpit builders attempting to manipulate these displays dynamically (e.g., adding a "Simulated Failure" message to the HUD), the net.dostring_in() function is the primary gateway. It allows the injection of Lua code from the GameGUI environment (Hook) into the Mission environment.
* Usage: net.dostring_in('mission', 'a_do_script("trigger.action.outText(...)")')
* Security Warning: As of DCS 2.9.18, Eagle Dynamics has tightened access to this function to prevent malicious code execution in multiplayer servers. Integrators must now explicitly allow-list scripts in the autoexec.cfg file if they wish to bridge data between the HUD rendering logic and external mission scripts.8
7.2 Font Replacement Strategy
To achieve "ultra-realistic" legibility, users often replace the default font textures.
1. Locate Atlas: Found in Mods/aircraft/[Module]/Cockpit/Resources/IndicationTextures.
2. Edit Texture: The RGB channels usually contain the stroke data.
3. Align Glyphs: The specific X/Y coordinates of every letter (A, B, C...) are defined in a Lua table (often fonts.lua or materials.lua). If a replacement font (e.g., "Amarillo USAF") is used, the glyph widths must match the original definition exactly, or the text on the HUD will have irregular kerning (spacing).
7.3 Data Export vs. Screen Export
A critical distinction for cockpit builders is that you cannot simply "export" the HUD screen to a second monitor for the A-10A or F-15C without performance penalties (rendering the scene twice). The preferred method is:
1. Use Export.lua to pull data (LoGetIndicatedAirSpeed).
2. Use software like Helios or Ikarus to render a new vector HUD on a secondary transparent LCD screen placed in the physical cockpit.
3. This reconstruction requires the exact "Ranges and Units" provided in Table 1 to ensure the physical HUD behaves identically to the virtual one.
8. Conclusion
The analysis reveals that while the A-10A and F-15C share a lineage of "Vector CRT" technology, their digital implementations diverge significantly in function—the A-10A prioritizing ground stabilization and pitch compression, the F-15C prioritizing radar integration (VSD-on-HUD) and kinematic launch zones. The rotary-wing platforms (UH-60L and AH-6) represent a shift toward head-mounted, conformal symbology, introducing complex 6-DOF coordinate transformations that couple aircraft telemetry with pilot head tracking. For the technical integrator, success lies in the precise manipulation of the HUD_definitions.lua scaling factors (K-values) and the careful handling of collimation parallax to match the physical display hardware.
