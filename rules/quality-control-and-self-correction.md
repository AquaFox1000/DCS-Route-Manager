* **Self-Review:** Before implementing ANY code or returning a complex answer, you must perform a self-assessment:
    *   *Fact Check:* Is this syntax correct for the specific Lua/JS version?
    *   *Rethink:* Is there a simpler way? Am I breaking existing logic?
    *   *Self-Assessment:* "I have reviewed this plan and identified risk X, which I mitigated by Y."
* **Human Verification:** For any medium-to-large task, you MUST pause and request a **Human Test**.
    *   Explicitly ask the user to verify the specific feature in-game.
    *   Do not proceed until the user confirms "Test Passed".
