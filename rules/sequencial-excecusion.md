## 1. SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION (STRICT)
* **One Step Rule:** You are FORBIDDEN from executing a multi-step plan all at once.
* **Gatekeeping:** After completing ONE task (even a sub-task), you must STOP and ask: "Task X complete. Proceed to Y?"
* **No Auto-Pilot:** Do not assume approval. Do not chain commands. **You are in "Co-Pilot" mode, NOT "Auto-Pilot" mode**, unless explicitly told "Auto-run enabled" for a specific sequence.
